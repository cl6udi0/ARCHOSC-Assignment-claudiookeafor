    <h2>Creating Folders</h2>
    <p>
        In the assignment I was given a task to create two new folders under the workspace folder:
        one for the “ArchOSC Assignment” and another folder for my saved screenshots.
        Then I was asked to screenshot the process and save it in the pictures folder.
        
    </p>

    <h2>Initializing Git Repository</h2>
    <p>
        Then I opened the terminal by right clicking the mouse and initiated the process by typing
        <strong>git init</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating GitHub Repository</h2>
    <p>
        After creating a local repository, I decided to create a new repository on GitHub by assigning
        the name <strong>ARCHOSC-Assignment-claudiookeafor</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>git hub repo</h2>

    <h2>Connecting Local Repository to GitHub</h2>
    <p>
        We then went back to the terminal and initiated a git init on the ArchOSC Assignment folder.
        After that, I added a remote repository using:
    </p>
    <pre>
git remote add origin [repository link]
git pull origin main
    </pre>
    <h2>git commit message</h2>

    <h2>Creating the Website</h2>
    <p>
        I opened a new file in Visual Studio Code, copied the piece of code,
        and saved it in my folder as <strong>index.html</strong>.
        Then I double-clicked it to open the web page.
